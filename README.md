IIT-Timetable - Madras Version
==============================

Running [here](https://krhariharan.github.io/IIT-Timetable/)

Got tired of making timetables from scratch every semester. Apparently [Manish Goregaokar](https://github.com/Manishearth) felt the same when he was studying at IITB. Forked [this](https://github.com/Manishearth/IIT-Timetable) his repo and modified the schedule in alignment with IIT Madras' timetable.

Have some time on your hands? Here are some updates that need to be done:
- Modify .ics xml for IITM's timetable and update the dates in the function for the live semester
- Beautification: As you can see, the website is fairly barebones at the moment, and HTML/CSS isn't exactly my forte. If your passion is web dev, have a go at this (a beginner project?)
- Anything else you can think of?
